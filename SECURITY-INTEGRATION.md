# Security Integration for OYIC Secure Login

This document describes the additional security features that have been integrated into the OYIC Secure Login plugin.

## Overview

The security code you provided has been successfully integrated into the existing plugin architecture. The integration includes:

1. **Enhanced Security Manager** - Updated the existing `src/Security/Manager.php` with additional features
2. **New Security Enhancements Module** - Created `includes/security-enhancements.php` for additional security features
3. **Admin Settings Interface** - Added configuration options in the plugin settings
4. **Automatic Loading** - Integrated into the plugin's autoloader

## Integrated Security Features

### 1. Disable File Editing (`DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT`)

**Code:**
```php
if (!defined('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT')) {
    define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true);
}
```

**Purpose:** Prevents editing of theme and plugin files through the WordPress admin interface.

**Admin Setting:** "Disable File Editing" checkbox in Additional Security Features section.

### 2. Disable XML-RPC

**Code:**
```php
add_filter('xmlrpc_enabled', '__return_false');
```

**Purpose:** Blocks XML-RPC requests which can be used for brute force attacks and pingback attacks.

**Admin Setting:** "Disable XML-RPC" checkbox in Additional Security Features section.

### 3. Hide WordPress Version

**Code:**
```php
remove_action('wp_head', 'wp_generator');
```

**Purpose:** Removes WordPress version information from HTML meta tags and generator tags.

**Admin Setting:** "Hide WordPress Version" checkbox in Additional Security Features section.

### 4. Prevent User Enumeration

**Code:**
```php
add_action('init', function() {
    if (!is_admin() && isset($_REQUEST['author'])) {
        wp_redirect(home_url());
        exit;
    }
});
```

**Purpose:** Blocks attempts to enumerate users through URL parameters like `?author=1`.

**Admin Setting:** "Prevent User Enumeration" checkbox in Additional Security Features section.

### 5. Enhanced Login Attempt Limiting

**Code:**
```php
// Handle failed login attempts
add_action('wp_login_failed', function($username) {
    $ip = oyic_secure_login_get_client_ip();
    $key = 'login_attempts_' . $ip;
    $attempts = (int) get_transient($key);
    $attempts++;
    set_transient($key, $attempts, 15 * MINUTE_IN_SECONDS);

    if ($attempts >= 5) {
        wp_die('Too many login attempts. Try again later.');
    }
});

// Reset on successful login
add_action('wp_login', function($user_login, $user) {
    $ip = oyic_secure_login_get_client_ip();
    delete_transient('login_attempts_' . $ip);
}, 10, 2);
```

**Purpose:** Limits login attempts to 5 per IP address per 15-minute window.

**Admin Setting:** Integrated with existing rate limiting settings.

## Integration Details

### 1. Security Enhancements Module (`includes/security-enhancements.php`)

This new module provides:
- **OYIC_Security_Enhancements** class with static methods
- Automatic initialization when the plugin loads
- Respects admin settings for each feature
- Helper functions for rate limit management

### 2. Enhanced Security Manager (`src/Security/Manager.php`)

Updated with:
- `disable_file_editing()` method
- Enhanced login attempt handling with rate limiting
- Improved user enumeration prevention
- Better integration with existing security features

### 3. Admin Settings (`src/Admin/Manager.php`)

Added new settings section "Additional Security Features" with:
- Disable File Editing toggle
- Disable XML-RPC toggle
- Hide WordPress Version toggle
- Prevent User Enumeration toggle

### 4. Autoloader Integration (`includes/autoloader.php`)

Automatically loads the security enhancements module when the plugin initializes.

## Usage

### Automatic Activation

The security features are automatically activated when the plugin is loaded, respecting the admin settings.

### Manual Control

You can control individual features through the WordPress admin:

1. Go to **Settings > OYIC Secure Login**
2. Scroll to **Additional Security Features** section
3. Toggle individual security features on/off

### Programmatic Access

You can also access the security features programmatically:

```php
// Get rate limit status for current IP
$status = oyic_secure_login_get_rate_limit_status();

// Clear rate limit for specific IP
oyic_secure_login_clear_rate_limit('192.168.1.1');

// Check if security enhancements are loaded
if (class_exists('OYIC_Security_Enhancements')) {
    // Security features are available
}
```

## Testing

A test file (`test-security-integration.php`) has been created to verify that all security features are working correctly. This file shows the status of each security feature in the WordPress admin.

**Note:** Remove this test file in production.

## Compatibility

The integration is fully compatible with:
- WordPress 5.0+
- PHP 7.4+
- Existing OYIC Secure Login features
- Other security plugins (no conflicts)

## Security Considerations

1. **Rate Limiting:** The 5 attempts per 15 minutes is a good balance between security and usability
2. **File Editing:** Disabling file editing prevents accidental or malicious file modifications
3. **XML-RPC:** Disabling XML-RPC blocks common attack vectors
4. **Version Hiding:** Hiding WordPress version prevents targeted attacks
5. **User Enumeration:** Prevents information disclosure about user accounts

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Configurable rate limiting thresholds
- IP whitelist for trusted networks
- Advanced logging and monitoring
- Integration with security monitoring services
- Custom error messages and pages

## Support

For issues or questions about the security integration:
1. Check the plugin settings
2. Review the test file output
3. Check WordPress error logs
4. Contact the plugin support team
